The fingers will have bellows. Bellows arranged in a non symmetrical way along the longitudinal axis, fill themselves with pressurized air or water to simultaneously swell. The swelling bellows push each other and bend the finger.
The attempted fabrication method to achieve the desired design with an active stiffening part as well as out of plane bending will mainly rely on molding. Thanks to the CAD design tool Fusion360, molds for soft cores and soft shell will be conceived. The technique has been used in the Microrobotics Laboratory and has shown some convincing field results \cite{galloway2016soft}. The shells and cores are made out of silicone and can be poured in 3D printed molds. The inner channels of the fingers are created through embedding a soft core that would later be pulled out.
